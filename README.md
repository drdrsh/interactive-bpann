# A web-based interactive visualization of artificial neural networks


This demo aims to serve as a tool to help visual learners, like myself, to gain visual intuition as to how artificial neural networks work. This demo allows a step-by-step iteration through a fully-connected backpropagation artificial neural network network to get some intuition as to what goes on during the process of training. It uses the latest Javascript technologies, particularly the "yield" keyword that allows clean loop pause and resume. The default demo attempts to learn an XOR problem.

**The demo is experimental and it uses the latest ES6 features so it won't work on all browsers, also the performance still needs optimization so I recommend running it in Google Chrome.**

The code still needs cleanup and further testing so issue reports and pull request are most welcome. The code is live on http://experiments.mostafa.io/public/ffbpann/
